# Pathfinding-in-Pacman

This repo was a short term project for CSCI 4511W (Artificial Intelligence) that uses a custom implementation of Pac-Man to compare different pathfinding algorithms. The basic Pac-Man game was written in Python 3 and utilizes non-standard libraries PIL (python imaging library) and pygame. Pathfinding algorithms are used to navigate Ghosts towards the Pac-Man sprite, where each ghost represents the use of a different search algorithm.

Installation:
  - since this program uses pygame and PIL you will need to make sure those are installed on your machine first.
  - This can be done using the pip install command:
      pip install pygame
      pip install PIL
  - Additional information on installing pygame can be found here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
